# 👋 A Brief Introduction

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), now in my third year, supervised by Professor Guang Zhang.

My research interests focus on **generative model theory and interpretability**. I am also interested in applied research that can generate practical value, such as **Fintech** and other domains.

My work has been published at venues including **ACL 2023**, **ACL 2025**, and **ICAIF**, with additional manuscripts under review at **ICLR**, **ACL Rolling Review (ARR)**, and **ICASSP**. I also serve as a reviewer for leading conferences such as **NeurIPS**, **ICLR**, and **AAAI**.
